	# We cant automate commit and push as they need to be separate steps
	# Commit - To local repo
	# Push - To central repo
	# Anyways we need to give a commit message which changes from commit to commit
	
4.) Pull:

	git fetch
	git merge master
	
	#.. fix any merge conflicts ..

# This is probably the same as what we do from GUI, but slightly simpler as there are no clicks involved.
# All authentication is in command line. I'll check out on how to resolve conflicts.
